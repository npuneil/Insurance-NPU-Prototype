# Insurance — On-Device AI Showcase 🛡️

A showcase application demonstrating on-device AI capabilities for insurance claims processing, running entirely on the NPU (Neural Processing Unit) via Microsoft Foundry Local. Optimized for Snapdragon X (QNN runtime). Works in airplane mode.

## On-Device AI Prototypes & Sample Code

### Overview

This repository contains prototypes, demos, and sample code that illustrate patterns for building on-device AI solutions. The content is provided for educational and demonstration purposes only to help developers explore ideas and implementation approaches.

This repository does not contain Microsoft products and is not a supported or production-ready offering.

### Prototype & Sample Code Disclosure

- All code and demos are experimental prototypes or samples.
- They may be incomplete, change without notice, or be removed at any time.

## Quick Start

```powershell
# First time:
Setup.bat          # or: .\Setup.ps1

# Every time:
StartApp.bat       # opens browser to http://localhost:5000
```

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 11 Copilot+ PC** with Snapdragon X NPU
- **Python 3.10+** (ARM64-native recommended for Snapdragon)
- **Foundry Local** installed (`winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal`)

## Snapdragon X Optimization

This app is optimized for ARM64 Snapdragon X devices:
- **WMI-based silicon detection** — correctly identifies Snapdragon under x64 emulation
- **No warmup on Snapdragon** — QNN runtime loads on first real request
- **NPU-first model chain**: qwen2.5-1.5b → phi-3-mini-4k → phi-3.5-mini → qwen2.5-7b
- **CPU fallback** when no NPU model is available

## Features

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Home** | Overview of on-device AI for insurance operations |
| **Claims AI** | Upload or describe property/vehicle damage → AI severity assessment, repair cost estimate, next steps |
| **Policy Assistant** | Chat about insurance policies, coverage, claims, and terminology |
| **Document Analyzer** | Paste policy docs or claim reports → summarize, extract data, or review for risks |
| **NPU Dashboard** | Live metrics, fleet-scale cost projections, carbon calculator, inference log |

## Sample Data

- 6 sample damage scenarios (flood, fire, hurricane, burst pipe, collapse, interior flood)
- Sample insurance policy document
- Voice dictation support for field adjusters

## Demo Experience

See `START_HERE.txt` for setup instructions and `DEMO_SCRIPT.txt` for a guided demo walkthrough.

**The key demo moment:** Run claims assessments → turn on airplane mode → run more assessments. They keep working. Show the NPU Dashboard — $0.00 in cloud costs. Project fleet savings: 10K adjusters × 50 inferences/day = 130M inferences/year, all on-device.
